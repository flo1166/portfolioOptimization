# portfolioOptimization
This code helps to perform a monte-carlo simulation. The simulation is famous in the area of finance, as it helps to calculate return and variance of a portfolio with weights and correlations.
+ Asset = saves the name, expected return
+ Covariance = saves the covariance for each asset
+ FitHeuristic = to calculate the portfolio return and variance and perform through a given repetation number to get best performing once of all performed portfolio weight combinations

Credits for the solution during lecture are given to Andreas Popp (Lecturer @ WFI) and @Andre Koners
